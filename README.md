# KIDS E-LIBRARY
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7fT4sv02dY&t=15s
#### Description:
The title of my project is Kids e-Library. This e-Library has books, reader can access 
the system and gets the book issued to read and return on the due date. The e-library shows a list of books which gives the reader a choice to choose from. 

The e-library is based on python programming language in which I have used Object Oriented Programming.
This program has two classes namely 1) Library class 2) Reader class. 

1) The library class has following functions: 

a) __init__
b) availableBooks
c) borrowBook
d) returnBook

Explanation of functions:

a) __init__

This function helps pass self and listOfBooks.

b) availableBooks

This function shows the list of books available to be issued to the reader.

c) issueBook

This function issues books to the reader showning his/her name also shows the date when the book is issued with time shown and the due date on which the book is to be returned.

d) returnBook

This function executes the return of the book back into the system.



2) The reader class has following functions:

a) requestBook
b) returnBook

a) requestBook

When a reader types the desired book and press Enter the function shows a message containing the title of the book and name of the reader with a date issued on and the date to be returned on.

b) returnBook

This function executes the return of the book by the reader typing the name of the book to be returned and the book is added back to the list in the e-library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have also written exit command in which the system asks the reader to recommend this e-library by typing "y"(YES) or "n"(NO) to their friends with their friend's email address.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project folder has one file with the title "readers_names.txt". This file automatically types the name of the reader when he/she uses the system by typing his/her name in order to issue books.
